#### **Lab: Building Your Portfolio Shell**

* **Level 1: The Single Page**  
  * **Tasks:** Create a project folder, create an index.html file, and add a single \<h1\> tag.  
  * **Outcome:** A single, local HTML file that can be opened in a web browser.  
* **Level 2: A Structured Project**  
  * **Tasks:** Create css and js sub-folders, create an empty styles.css file, add HTML boilerplate, and link the stylesheet.  
  * **Outcome:** A well-organized project folder with linked CSS, ready for styling.  
* **Level 3: The Multi-Page Site Shell & Version Control**  
  * **Tasks:** Create additional HTML pages (about.html, contact.html), initialize a Git repository, and make your first commit.  
  * **Outcome:** A complete, multi-page static website skeleton, safely tracked in version control history.  
* **Level 4: Professional Repository Setup**  
  * **Tasks:** Create a README.md and a .gitignore file. Add a basic navigation section to all pages and commit the changes.  
  * **Outcome:** A professional-looking local Git repository that includes documentation and ignores unnecessary files.  
* **Level 5: Advanced Workflow & Remote Setup**  
  * **Tasks:** Create and switch to a develop branch. Create a new repository on GitHub, link your local repo to it, and push your branches.  
  * **Outcome:** A project that is not only version-controlled locally but also backed up remotely on GitHub, following a standard branching workflow.
